## Description
This CMS-style blog application is similar to a Wordpress site, where users can publish their blog posts and comment on other users' posts as well.  Users can edit and delete their own blog posts and they have a dashboard view to display only their own posts.
## Installation
Application can be used online with user interface.  To make it your own and deploy it somewhere else, clone the repository, be sure to be running node.js, with Sequelize installed then install the packages with "npm i".  Then run "npm start" to begin or "npm run watch" for developer mode. Use localhost:3001.
## Usage
Use as an interactive database of user blog posts and comments. User must first register in order to be able to login to blog.  Once logged in, user can create, edit and delete their own blog posts.  Users can also comment on other users' posts.
This application could be used for any type of content or interests that users' share.  Future development could enhance UI, create user profiles with photos, as well as many other features specific to the content intended for the blog.
